                                                indocument stylesheets, so that my resume could
                                                be more portable, since I intend to use it in 
                                                the future, when it is finished of course.-->

        <h1>A little bit about myself</h1>
        <p style="padding-left: 50px;"> My name is Haris Berilo, and I am a Bosnian-born student currently<br>
                                        abiding in Bosnia and Herzegovina. I am 20 years old, and a student<br>
                                        of the International University of Sarajevo, Computer Science<br>
                                        curriculum. My interests include a variety of topics but computers<br>
                                        and anything to do with them is the most important one to me.<br>
                                        I'm usually available for contact or a chat, preferably over e-mail.<br>
                                        Any further questions should also be sent via e-mail.<br><br>
                                        I prefer talking in English, but my mother-tounge is Bosnian.<br>
                                        I also have a basic understanding of German, Turkish and Polish,<br>
                                        and a written understanding of Arabic. <br><br>
                                        To the right, you should be able to see a picture of me (at graduation).<br><br>
                                        Aditionally, all of the assets in this document (pictures, icons and the<br>
                                        resume itself) was made by me for the purposes of this resume.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>before high-school (x-2014.):</b> attended many competitions and education seminars<br> in the topics of IT,
                 computing and the English language. I also attended my primary school's English, Mathematics and Coding club. 
                 My proudest achievements in this period were my Coding competitions (1st in my municipality, 4th in canton, 
                 and attended the country championsip) and English (I placed 6th in my country).</li>
            <br><li><b>during high-school (2014-2018):</b> attended my high-school's Mathematics and Coding<br>
                clubs, and worked closely with the professors holding these clubs. I was also a<br>
                representative of my class, and member of the Student Council for the last two years of<br>
                school. During the last two years as well, I organised a project about helping students make their CVs and resumes; 
                I also volunteered at the British Embassy for one day and spoke with H.E. the British Ambassador in private in a roundtable 
                discussion about the youth.<br>During this time I also became a member of the <a href="https://unabih.org/">United Nations Association in<br>
                Bosnia and Hercegovina</a>, and during the end of 2018. and through 2019. I would go on to organize many events as its member.<br>
                I also attended many seminars and discussions on various topics.</li>
            <br><li><b>Sarajevo MUN Conference 2019:</b> all throughout 2019. I worked on organizing the <br><a href="https://unabih.org/">Sarajevo Model United Nations</a> conference
                under the position of Logistics Director, responsible for seeking out, discussing, finalizing and procuring sponsorships
                (drinks, lunch venues and dinner events), conference material (pens, notebooks, ID tags etc.), as well as helping <br>
                the Social Events Director and Chief of Staff with their duties. During the later months into organizing the <br>
                conference, I was promoted to the position of Acting Project Manager, and I managed the conference until it's end<br>
                on the 29th of September 2019. I was also responsible for writing the official Conference Report and Finiancial Report.</li>
            <br><li><b>IUS Model United Nations club:</b> in 2020, along with my friend Anes Kadic, I would go on to establish <br>
                the Model United Nations club at IUS. The goal of establishing this club was to promote the values of the United<br>
                Nations at my University and to organize many events related to the Sustainable Development Goals and<br>
                the Agenda 2030. as well as bring useful guest speakers and information to my fellow students in the form of <br>
                roundtable discussions and seminars. The club as of November 2020. has 20 members, with our club advisor<br>

        <h1>My hobbies, briefly</h1>

        <img src="art1.jpg" title="One of my more surreal drawings inspired by the word - indecision." alt="One of my drawings." width="300" style="float: right;">

        <p style="padding-left: 50px;"> I enjoy many things and I am a man of many interests, I would say.<br>
                                        Computers and anything to do with them is my main area of expertise and of <br>
                                        personal interest. Coding, particularly Python and C++, is something I love,<br>
                                        as well as researching and keeping up with computer hardware, CPUs, graphics cards<br>
                                        and the computer and videogame/esports industry. I quite enjoy all sorts of<br>
                                        computer games, from real-time strategy games and esport shooters, to simpler<br>
                                        ones like chess. I also occasionally draw graphical or conventional drawings and<br>
                                        dabble in video and graphical editing. To the right you can see one of my more<br>
                                        "surreal" drawings.<br>
                                        Besides my main interests, I am also thoroughly enjoy all genres of music both<br>
                                        modern and old. A personal favourite as of writing this would be the band <i>Sabaton</i><br>
                                        because of their tendency to describe real-life battles of history and events that<br>
                                        are to be talked about, while still balancing very satisfying guitar-play.
                                        As well as this, I am quite interested in world politics, history, the <i>deep-state</i><br>
                                        and the United Nations and its goals.
                                        The last "hobby" I would like to mention, and the one that takes up most of my free<br>
                                        time is the Internet as a phenomena and its contents and different aspects. I've been<br>
                                        lurking around the Internet for as long as I can remember and have a lot of knowledge<br>
                                        about modern and old Internet culture and its inner workings and with such, have made<br>
                                        many aquaintances over the years in different parts of the globe.<br></p>
